SetEndDate READMEHow do I run this?1. Download and place the scripts in a folder SetEndDate. * In this folder you should have EndDate.py , all.py  and  txt files with the links.2. Use the Command Line/Prompt and use the “cd” to get to the folder that you just made Example: ~ doni$ cd SetEndDate ((Hit enter))3. Once inside of the folder you should be able to call the scripts and run them.In the Command Line you have to include 3 argument files Example call:  SetEndDate doni$ python all.py logfile.txt noAccess.txtlogfile.txt and noAccess.txt will be created later. All the comments about changing the date will be listed in the logfile.txt. Selenium_test_user account, which is used in this script, doesn’t have access to all of the moodle sites, that is why all the courses with no access will be written to the noAccess.txt file. In order to access them, try AccessEndDate script where your password is required.
